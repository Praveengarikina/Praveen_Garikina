Multiple Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

Abstract:
There are multiple techniques in machine learning that can in a variety of industries, do predictive analytics on large amounts of data. Predictive analytics in healthcare is a difficult        endeavor, but it can eventually assist practitioners in making timely decisions regarding patients' health and treatment based on massive data. Many diseases are causing many affects globally but most of these affects are due to the lack of timely check-ups of the diseases. The above problem occurs due to a lack of medical infrastructure and a low ratio of doctors to the population. The statistics clearly show the same, WHO recommended, the ratio of doctors to patients is 1:1000 whereas India's doctor-to-population ratio is 1:1456, this indicates the shortage of doctors. This work is all about predicting diseases that are harmful using machine learning classification algorithms. 
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting multiple diseases based on input symptoms. By utilizing a dataset containing various symptoms and corresponding diseases, the project implements data preprocessing, feature selection, and machine learning classification techniques. The model is trained and evaluated using multiple algorithms to achieve the best predictive accuracy. The results indicate that machine learning can effectively assist in early disease detection, providing a valuable tool for the healthcare industry.
